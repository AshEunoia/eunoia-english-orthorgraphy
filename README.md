# Eunoia English orthography (EEO)

*(yûnöa ingliß ôфografê)*

*by Ash Eunoia*

I don't like the way English is currently spelt, so here I have created a version that in my opinion is an improvement. Critique will be met with consideration since I'm not an expert!

Examples at the bottom!

## Principles

- Consistency is king.
- Maximisations:
  - Visual, aural, and audio aesthetics.
  - Memorability.
  - Explicitness. Or explicit is better than implicit.
  - Intuitiveness.
  - Practical: Human-laziness is a consideration.

## Requirements

In no particular order:

- Audio-visual isomorphism.
  - 1 vowel, 1 letter.
  - 1 consonant, 1 letter.
- Minimal usage of diacritics.
- Should use pre-existing unicode characters.
- Should be easy to type.
- Should be easy to hand write in cursive.
- Letters should be as distinguishable as possible. For example, O and 0 are too similar. Note: o and 0 are currently permitted, but are contentious.
- Letters chosen should correspond to their sound as much as possible, for memorability.
- All English sounds should be preserved, notwithstanding nuances between accents.
- Capitals are unnecessary. This is because it seems excessive to require the learning of an entire alphabet just for the purposes of formatting, which in my opinion should be left to bold, italic, underscore, font size, etc.
- Minimal change from English.

## Considerations

- Different accents will use different spellings. I don't feel this is a big concern.
- Typing might seem like a concern, but since there are no capitals a large amount of keys have become available, so much so there are plenty to spare!
- the dot about i may not be necessary in EEO.

## Vowels

Given there are 20 vowel sounds in English, notwithstanding accents, using a unique letter for each is not only difficult while ensuring the letters are highly distinguishable, but possibly hard to memorise.

In EEO there are 2 solutions to this problem: diphthongs and diacritics.

## Vowel diacritics

For these reasons 4 diacritics are used, which modify the sound of the primary vowel in each vowel group.

The primary vowels in EEO are a, e, i, o, u, c, and importantly are short.

| Name       | Symbol | Description                              |
| :--------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Circumflex | ˆ      | Long primary.                            |
| Caron      | ˇ      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'u'. |
| Diaeresis  | ¨      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'i'. |
| Macron     | ˉ      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'c'. |

They were chosen to be as intuitive as possible:

- Circumflex: Highly distinguishable from the dot of 'i'.
- Caron: Reminiscent of a 'u'. There is no single character breve in unicode, else that would have been used.
- Diaeresis: Reminiscent of the dot of 'i'.
- Macron: 'c' or /ə/ is a very flat sounding.

### Typing

There are at least 3 ways of typing the diacritics:

- Typing the primary vowel, then the diacritic to be added to it. Could be worth having a keyboard layout where shift does not need to be pressed to type a diacritic, where lesser used consonants would require shift instead. This would likely be the fastest.
- Each vowel with diacritic has its own keyboard key, but would likely need to press shift to access it which is slow.
- Types the vowel pairs, where software replaces the pairs with the diacritic version. This may be the most convenient, but not quite the fastest.

## Vowel diphthongs

TODO: The diphthong version of vowels is currently broken.

Note: A diphthong is 2 vowels letters combined to make 1 vowel sound.

## Table of vowels

There is a lot going on in the following table.

There are 2 ways to represent vowels, as a single letter sometimes with a diacritic or as a diphthong. The pair is useful if diacritics are not possible to type with a particular keyboard layout.

The vowels are split into 7 groups based on their primary sound. This sound is short. It can be lengthened to produce the next vowel of the group. Then after come the diphthongs.

Note: 'c' is used instead of 'ə' because 'ə' can be confused with 'a' in certain fonts, and 'c' is unused as a consonant in EEO.

Note: The normalised IPA is shown to demonstrate more clearly the emergent nature of the grouping.

### Notes

- When sounding a consonant by itself, it is spoken with 'c' after the consonant, such as 'fc' or 'qc'.
- 'ß' instead of 'ʃ' because 'ʃ' can be more easily confused with 's'.

## Issues

- Many spelling collisions. Though not exactly new to English, it would be nice if each word had only one sense, however this is outside the scope of EEO.
- English grammar is still inconsistent. This can be solved by using Lojban instead of English.
- Acronyms will require a different representation than all capitals. yûnöa ingliß ôфografê could be y.i.ô (E.E.O in normal English).

## Comparisons with English

There are 22 consonant letters, 7 vowel letters, and 20 vowel diphthongs, and 42 sounds that are explicitly represented.

In normal English there are just as many sounds, depending on the dialect, but they are ***not*** explicitly represented. In fact there are a significant number sounds that don't have characters at all, including 15 of the 20 vowels, such as /ə/, the most common vowel in English.

The normal English alphabet has 48 letters, including capitals, but not including letters that have diacritics such as 'cliché'. EEO has 33 symbols, counting the primary vowels and diacritics separately, 15 less letters than normal English. Counting all combinations of vowels and diacritics, EEO still has 6 fewer letters than normal English.

One might thing vowel diphthongs in EEO would overall increases the number of letters that need to be written, but given the change in spelling, over the course of a paragraph it is most likely diphthongs EEO has significantly fewer letters. This is primarily due to the quantity of redundant letters in English spelling.

## Examples

***Note:*** I'm not currently sure when to use 'c' vs 'j', so simply use 'c' exclusively.

All English letters:

- **English:**  
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
- **EEO diacritic:**  
δc kwik brǎn foks dεcmps čvc δc lëzî dog.
- **EEO diphthong:**  
Tc kwik braun foks dEcmps cuvc Tc leizii dog.

Quote from 'The Mikado' by W.S. Gilbert:

- **English:**  
To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,  
In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,  
Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,  
From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!
- **EEO diacritic:**  
tû sit in solcm sälcns in a dcl, dâk dok,  
in a pestilenßcl prizcn, wiδ a läf-loq lok,  
awëtiq δc sensëßcn ov a ßôt, ßâp ßok,  
from a tßîp and tßipî tßopc on a big blak blok!
- **EEO diphthong:**  
tuu sit in solcm sailcns in a dcl, daak dok,  
in a pestilenBcl prizcn, wiT a laif-loq lok,  
aweitiq Tc senseiBcn ov a Boot, Baap Bok,

### Excerpt

Excerpt from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language>.

**English:**

A constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial languages, planned languages or invented languages and in some cases, fictional languages. Planned languages are languages that have been purposefully designed. They are the result of deliberate controlling intervention, thus of a form of language planning.

**English:**

There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code); to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning; for artistic creation; and for language games. Some people make constructed languages simply because they like doing it.
