# Eunoia English orthography (EEO)

*(yûnöa ingliß ôфografê)*

*by Ash Eunoia*

I don't like the way English is currently spelt, so here I have created a version that in my opinion is an improvement. Critique will be met with consideration since I'm not an expert!

## Trivia

- In EEO there are 24 consonants, and 20 vowels, for a total of 44 sounds that are explicitly represented.
  - Currently in English there are just as many sounds, depending on the dialect, but they are ***not*** explicitly represented. In fact there are a significant number sounds that don't have characters at all, including 15 of the 20 vowels, such as /ə/, the most common vowel in English.
- The current English alphabet has 48 letters, including capitals, but not including letters that have diacritics such as in 'cliché'. EEO has 31 letters.

## Principles

- Consistency is king.
- Maximisations:
  - Visual, aural, and audio aesthetics.
  - Memorability.
  - Explicitness. Or explicit is better than implicit.
  - Intuitiveness.
  - Practical: Human-laziness is a consideration.

## Requirements

In no particular order:

- Audio-visual isomorphism.
  - 1 vowel, 1 letter.
  - 1 consonant, 1 letter.
- Minimal usage of diacritics.
- Should use pre-existing unicode characters.
- Should be easy to type.
- Should be easy to hand write in cursive.
- Letters should be as distinguishable as possible. For example, O and 0 are too similar. Note: o and 0 are currently permitted, but are contentious.
- Letters chosen should correspond to their sound as much as possible, for memorability.
- All English sounds should be preserved, notwithstanding nuances between accents.
- Capitals are unnecessary. This is because it seems excessive to require the learning of an entire alphabet just for the purposes of formatting, which in my opinion should be left to bold, italic, underscore, font size, etc.
- Minimal change from English.

## Considerations

- Different accents will use different spellings. I don't feel this is a big concern.
- Typing might seem like a concern, but since there are no capitals a large amount of keys have become available, so much so there are plenty to spare!
- the dot about i may not be necessary in EEO.

## Issues

- Many spelling collisions. Though not exactly new to English, it would be nice if each word had only one sense.
- English grammar is still inconsistent. This can be solved by using Lojban instead of English.
- How can acronyms be represented?

## Vowels

Given there are 20 vowel sounds in English, notwithstanding accents, using a unique letter for each is not only difficult while ensuring the letters are highly distinguishable, but possibly hard to memorise.

In EEO there are 2 solutions to this problem: diphthongs and diacritics.

## Vowel diacritics

For these reasons 4 diacritics are used, which modify the sound of the primary vowel in each vowel group.

The primary vowels in EEO are a, e, i, o, u, c, and importantly are short.

| Name       | Symbol | Description                              |
| :--------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| Circumflex | ˆ      | Long primary.                            |
| Caron      | ˇ      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'u'. |
| Diaeresis  | ¨      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'i'. |
| Macron     | ˉ      | Diphthong ending with primary vowel 'c'. |

They were chosen to be as intuitive as possible:

- Circumflex: Highly distinguishable from the dot of 'i'.
- Caron: Reminiscent of a 'u'. There is no single character breve in unicode, else that would have been used.
- Diaeresis: Reminiscent of the dot of 'i'.
- Macron: 'c' or /ə/ is a very flat sounding.

### Comparisons with English

Using diacritics there are 24 consonants, 7 vowel letters, and 4 diacritics.

That is a total of 31 letters not including diacritics, 17 less than current English.

There are 13 combinations of vowels with diacritics, and counting each as a letter gives a total of 44 letters, 4 less than current English.

Diacritics overall decrease the number of letters that need to be written, though are about as fast to type as current English.
Using diacritics is much easier to read than pairs.

### Typing

There are at least 3 ways of typing the diacritics:

- Typing the primary vowel, then the diacritic to be added to it. Could be worth having a keyboard layout where shift does not need to be pressed to type a diacritic, where lesser used consonants would require shift instead. This would likely be the fastest.
- Each vowel with diacritic has its own keyboard key, but would likely need to press shift to access it which is slow.
- Types the vowel pairs, where software replaces the pairs with the diacritic version. This may be the most convenient, but not quite the fastest.

## Vowel diphthongs

TODO: The diphthong version of vowels is currently broken.

Note: A diphthong is 2 vowels letters combined to make 1 vowel sound.

### Comparisons with English

There are 24 consonants, 8 vowel letters, and 20 vowel pairs.

That is a total of 32 letters, 16 less letters than current English.

Vowel pairing overall increases the number of letters that need to be written.

## Table of vowels

There is a lot going on in the following table.

There are 2 ways to represent vowels, as a single letter sometimes with a diacritic or as a diphthong. The pair is useful if diacritics are not possible to type with a particular keyboard layout.

The vowels are split into 7 groups based on their primary sound. This sound is short. It can be lengthened to produce the next vowel of the group. Then after come the diphthongs.

Note: 'c' is used instead of 'ə' because 'ə' can be confused with 'a' in certain fonts, and 'c' is unused as a consonant in EEO.

Note: The normalised IPA is shown to demonstrate more clearly the emergent nature of the grouping.

### Notes

- When sounding a consonant by itself, it is spoken with <c> after the consanant, such as <fc> or <qc>.
- ß instead of ʃ because ʃ can be more easily confused with s.

Quote from 'The Mikado' by W.S. Gilbert:

- **English:**  
To sit in solemn silence in a dull, dark dock,  
In a pestilential prison, with a life-long lock,  
Awaiting the sensation of a short, sharp shock,  
From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block!

### Excerpt

Excerpt from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language>.

**English:**

A constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial languages, planned languages or invented languages and in some cases, fictional languages. Planned languages are languages that have been purposefully designed. They are the result of deliberate controlling intervention, thus of a form of language planning.

**English:**

There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code); to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning; for artistic creation; and for language games. Some people make constructed languages simply because they like doing it.
